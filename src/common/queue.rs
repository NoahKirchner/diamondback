/*
Queue Object

Essentially a wrapper around VecDeque that implements thread
safety via mutexes and allows for empty checks to avoid
having to deal with options during a loop.

P.S. I know there is a lot of copy pasted code, but I figured
it would be easier to read than a bunch of nested functions.
